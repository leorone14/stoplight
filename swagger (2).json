        "description": "### Description\nThe PISP sent a Payment/Transfer Request through a POST command.\nThe ASPSP registered the Payment/Transfer Request, updated if necessary the relevant identifiers in order to avoid duplicates and returned the location of the updated Request.\nThe PISP got the Payment/Transfer Request that was updated with the resource identifiers, and eventually the status of the Payment/Transfer Request and the status of the subsequent credit transfer.\nThe PISP request for the payment cancellation (global cancellation) or for some payment instructions cancellation (partial cancellation)\nNo other modification of the Payment/Transfer Request is allowed.\n### Prerequisites\n- The TPP was registered by the Registration Authority for the PISP role\n- The TPP was provided with an OAUTH2 \"Client Credential\" access token by the ASPSP (cf. § 3.4.2).\n- The TPP previously posted a Payment/Transfer Request which was saved by the ASPSP (cf. § 4.5.3)\n  - The ASPSP answered with a location link to the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. § 4.5.4)\n  - The PISP retrieved the saved Payment/Transfer Request (cf. § 4.5.4)\n- The TPP and the ASPSP successfully processed a mutual check and authentication\n- The TPP presented its \"OAUTH2 Client Credential\" access token.\n- The TPP presented the payment/transfer request.\n- The PSU was successfully authenticated.\n\n### Business flow\n#### Payment/Transfer request cancellation circumstances\nThe cancellation of a Payment/Transfer request might be triggered by the PISP upon request of the PSU.\nIt can also be triggered by the PISP itself in case of error or fraud detection.\nSince the consequence of the cancellation will be a rejection of the Payment/Transfer request globally or limited to some of its instructions, the modification of the payment request will focus on setting the relevant status to the value \"CANC\".\nThis \"CANC\" status must however be explained through a reason code that can be set with the following values:\n\n| Reason | description |\n| ------ | ----------- |\n| DS02 | The PSU himsef/herself ordered the cancellation. |\n| DUPL | The PISP requested the cancellation for a duplication of a previous Payment/Transfer request |\n| FRAD | The PISP requested the cancellation for fraudulent origin of the Payment/Transfer request |\n| TECH | The PISP requested the cancellation for a technical issue on its side |\n\n#### Payment/Transfer request cancellation level\n- Case of a payment with multiple instructions or a standing order, the PISP asks to cancel the whole Payment/Transfer or Standing Order Request including all non-executed payment instructions by setting the [paymentInformationStatus] and the relevant [statusReasonInformation]  at payment level.\n- Case of a payment with multiple instructions, the PISP asks to cancel one or several payment instructions by setting the [transactionStatus] and the relevant [statusReasonInformation] at each relevant instruction level.\n\nThe cancellation request might need a PSU authentication before committing, especially when the request is PSU-driven. In other cases, the ASPSP may consider that a PSU authentication is irrelevant.\nIn order to meet all possibilities, the cancellation request must nevertheless include:\n- The specification of the authentication approaches that are supported by the PISP (any combination of \"REDIRECT\", \"EMBEDDED-1-FACTOR\" and \"DECOUPLED\" values).\n- In case of possible REDIRECT or DECOUPLED authentication approach, one or two call-back URLs to be used by the ASPSP at the finalisation of the authentication and consent process :\n  - The first call-back URL will be called by the ASPSP if the Transfer Request is processed without any error or rejection by the PSU\n  - The second call-back URL is to be used by the ASPSP in case of processing error or rejection by the PSU. Since this second URL is optional, the PISP might not provide it. In this case, the ASPSP will use the same URL for any processing result.\n  - Both call-back URLS must be used in a TLS-secured request.\n- In case of possible \"EMBEDDED-1-FACTOR\" or \"DECOUPLED\" approaches, a PSU identifier that can be processed by the ASPSP for PSU recognition.\n\n- The ASPSP saves the updated Payment/Transfer Request and answers to the PISP. The answer embeds\n  - The specification of the chosen authentication approach taking into account both the PISP and the PSU capabilities.\n  - In case of chosen REDIRECT authentication approach, the URL to be used by the PISP for redirecting the PSU in order to perform an authentication.\n\nCase of the PSU neither gives nor denies his/her consent, the Cancellation Request shall expire and is then rejected to the PISP. The expiration delay is specified by each ASPSP.\nIf any modification of the payment request other than cancellation is applied by the PISP, the ASPSP must rejest the request with HTTP403 without modifying the payment request resource.\n\nThere is no need for the PISP to POST a confirmation of the cancellation request. \n",
